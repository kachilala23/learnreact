React Process

What is React
This is a javascript library for building user interfaces.
It is a component based system. i.e. combination of different components to 

Get started

// This means create create app in the current folder we are in.
npx create-react-app .

// This will start your application. It takes time initially.
npm start

It generates two url for you. If you are online and offline.

In the public folder we have index.html and it contains a gigantic html in it.

In the src folder is where all our application code is going to go.
index.js in the source folder is what hooks up our html file to our actual javascript.


After deleting everything react generated for us we return Hello World from App.js.

ReactDOM.render() method in index.js takes in the <App /> as a parameter and it is using document.getElementById
to get the id root. The id root can be located in index.html in public folder. 

So index.js is rendering whatsoever is inside the component App. And it is rendering it inside the root id by using the getElementById
Since App.js is a functional component whatever it returns is what gets rendered in the div with root id.

Rendring just string is not very useful we actually want to render html and to do that we make use of what is known as JSX.

JSX
This helps us to write html inside of our javascript. Like we know writing html inside javscript is very complex but with JSX it makes 
it faily easy.

To test this out in the App component we will change the returned string to html by wrapping it in an html tag.
We need to either make use of JSX fragment <></> and wrap everything within it or we make use of a div.

We are going to make a counter app to help us understand react.
